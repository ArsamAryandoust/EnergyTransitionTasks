# A collection of datasets and prediction tasks for enhancing the global energy transition

An effective way to reduce global greenhouse gases and mitigate climate change
is to electricity most of our energy consumption and supply it from renewable
energy sources, which is mostly about wind and solar. In this repository, we are 
providing a number of prediction tasks and datasets from different domains such 
as mobility, climate science and material science that all contribute to solving 
the complex set of problems involved in enhancing the global energy transition 
towards highly renewable electricity systems.

In the following, each dataset and prediction task is described in further detail.

### UberMovement

The Uber Movement project provides travel time data between different city zones
for more than 50 cities around the globe under a CC BY-NC 3.0 US license 
(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/). Travel time data is important
for many applications of planning urban mobility. In the light of the energy 
transition, a recent study shows how Uber Movement travel time data can be used 
to estimate car parking density maps. These maps allow local distribution operators
for electricity and local city governance to better understand where cars are 
parked at what times. This then shows what it requires in terms of power flows and
the distribution of electric charging stations for electrifying urban mobility.
