Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subfield of machine learning (ML) have a
significant potential for enhancing technologies, policies and social processes
that we urgently need for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Improving the
design of AI and ML models for tackling the energy transition, however, requires
knowledge about the characteristics of prediction tasks and datasets that are involved.
The current literature lacks a collection of relevant prediction tasks and their
datasets, as well as an analysis of their characteristics and relationships to each
other. In this repository, we review the literature of prediction tasks that are
relevant for enhancing the global energy transition and process a collection of
public datasets into a single tabular data format (.csv) for these to simplify the
design of new AI and ML models for solving them.

* If you have published or unpublished datasets that fit our purpose, your 
contribution is highly appreciated. For changes to code, please download this 
repository, create a new branch, push your changes to the repository, and 
create a pull request to the `latest_release` branch.

* If you are using the datasets we provide here and have identified any 
problems with these or want to suggest ways to improve these, your feedback is 
highly appreciated. For this, please go to the `Discussions` tab, create a 
`New discussion`, and give us your detailed feedback.
