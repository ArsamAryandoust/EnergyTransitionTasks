## Contributions

We use two long-lived branches for this project, `develop` and `master`.

```
-------------------------------------master-------------------------------------
------------------------------------develop-------------------------------------
```


In order to get started with contributing code, follow these steps:
  1. `git clone https://github.com/ArsamAryandoust/EnergyTransitionTasks` or\
  `git clone https://<your_personal_access_token>@github.com/ArsamAryandoust/EnergyTransitionTasks`
  2. `cd EnergyTransitionTasks`
  3. `git checkout develop`
  4. `git branch <your_personal_branch>`
  5. `git checkout <your_personal_branch>`
  
  
```
-------------------------------------master-------------------------------------
------------------------------------develop-------------------------------------
            ----------------<your_personal_branch>----------------
```

All changes that you make should be done to `<your_personal_branch>`. In a running workflow, where others from the team are contributing to the project simultaneously, you should always make sure that your code has no collision with the latest changes to the `develop` branch, before opening a pull request. For this, please follow these steps:
  1. `git checkout <your_personal_branch>`
  2. `git fetch origin develop:develop`
  3. `git merge develop` (resolve conflicts locally, if they occur)
  4. `git push -u origin <your_personal_branch>`
  5. On the remote host, create a pull request for `<your_personal_branch>` into the `develop` branch 
  
  
While making changes to `<your_personal_branch>`, you can create arbitrary short-lived branches named `<your_feature_branch>` originating from `<your_personal_branch>`. Make sure you test and merge/rebase these smaller feature branches before pushing `<your_personal_branch>` to the remote repository and openning a pull request.


```
-------------------------------------master-------------------------------------
------------------------------------develop-------------------------------------
            ----------------<your_personal_branch>----------------
                     -------<your_feature_branch>-------
```

Warning notice:

Do NOT use Rebase on commits that you have already pushed to a remote repository! Instead, use Rebase only for cleaning up your local commit history before merging it into a shared team branch.
