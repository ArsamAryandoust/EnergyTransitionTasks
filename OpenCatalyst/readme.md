# Open Catalyst

The Open Catalyst project provides data on about 1.3 million molecular relaxations
with results from over 260 million density functional theory calculations from
quantum mechanical simulations under a CC Attribution 4.0 International licence
(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode). The goal is to predict 
and find cost-effective electrocatalysts for producing synthetic fuels like 
hydrogen with excess renewable energy from intermittent wind and and solar [1]. 
Common state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for both producing hydrogen and consuming
it again use expensive noble metals such as iridium and platinum. If these can be
replaced by new cost-effective catalysts, an earlier adoption of hydrogen energy
storage systems may be achieved due to significant cost reductions. Data from the
periodic table of elements is collected from here: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/.

A critical view on hydrogen is provided in https://blogs.ethz.ch/energy/h2-or-not/
