### Building Electricity

The Building Electricity dataset provides electricity consumption profiles of about 
100 and 400 single buildings in 2014, aerial imagery data of these buildings and
and meteorlogical conditions in the area of these buildings during the same year
under an MIT license (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). The goal is to predict
the electric consumption profile of single buildings for the next 24h in 15-min
time steps (96 values) at different times as the only ground truth data in the 
prediction task from only remotely sensed features consisting of meterological data
and aerial imagery of buildings [4].
