"""TODO:
This module will contain all classes and functions required for uploading any 
dataset to the specified public data repository. We will use these to upload 
both our raw data to a remote repository as well as our unified data.

- use a new jupyter notebook on path 'EnergyTransitionTasks/notebooks/' or 
  'EnergyTransitionTasks/src/main.py' as the main entry point for loading this 
  module and calling its functions.
- use 'EnergyTransitionTasks/config.yml' to specify your configurations and 
  load it as a dictionary that you pass to functions defined in this module.
- decide what best goes into cfg.yml, and what best is passed as additional
  arguments to the implemented functions.
- introduce classes and other objects where useful!
