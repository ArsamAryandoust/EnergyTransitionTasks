### Uber Movement

The Uber Movement project provides travel time data between different city zones
in the form of origin-destination matrices for about 50 cities around the world 
under a CC BY-NC 3.0 US license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/). 
Travel time data can be used, among many other things in planning urban mobility, 
to infer where cars are parked at what times throughout a day, week, season and 
year in a city [1]. This information is important for planning and operating power 
systems in places where we are transitioning to using electric cars. For example, 
it will allow us to know how much power must flow to which parts of a city when 
electricity generation from solar power is to be used to charge electrc vehicles 
during mid-day.
