# ClimART

The ClimART project provides data on the inputs and outputs of the Canadian Earth
System Model for emulating atmospheric radiative transfer between the years 1850 
and 2100 under a CC BY 4.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
The computation of atmospheric radiative transfer is the computational bottleneck 
for current weather and climate models due to its large complexity [1]. Training
machine learning models that are able to predict such model outputs at faster 
computational speed can therefore fill the information gaps for times and places
where earth system model are too computationaly expensive to be run.
